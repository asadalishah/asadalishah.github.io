No other code in this post, I promise. That comes in subsequent posts.


## A borrwed title, “not that there’s anything wrong with that”

Adorning the title of this first blog post with a line from Sienfeld – “not that there’s anything wrong with that” - gives me great pleasure and satisfaction. For those of you who are interested, this dialogue was delivered (many times) in the “The Outing”, the 57th episode of Seinfeld.


## Learn R, Learn Not R

It has happened many a time to me; I started R with great excitement and then got discouraged soon when I was unable to get the data, get it properly in R. In hindsight, that was because of an availablity of abundance of resources. Each resource had a different way of doing the same thing. Some had a more puritain approach where Base R must be learnt before anything else. Others propogated short-cuts which went over my head. Talk about irony.


## Stumbling Upon (Happiness) R

This time proved to different. How?

The objective of this course [Introduction to R for Journalists: How to Find Great Stories in Data] (https://journalismcourses.org/course/view.php?id=9) at its most basic, obviously is to teach journalists how to use R. (You might have to sign up to access the course.) The instructor has assumed nothing. He has covered the basics of R, and how man how thoroughly he did that is amazing.


## Course and its details

While he covered the basics, he realized – thankfully – that Base R is not the best to teach basics. So he did it with the Tidyverse packages.

The course has six modules, as follows:

1. How to use R
2. Importing/Exporting data
3. Wrangling data
4. Visualizing data
5. Spatial analysis
6. Publishing
7. Git

Please explore the modules yourself. Each module is elaborate and doesn’t leave anything to chance. For example, Importing/Exporting data goes through importing from five different types of files: CSV, Excel, Delimited, JSON and SPSS. And that is not all. It also covers copying and pasting data – something which the instructor discourages – and folder of files.


## And an(other) R Blog was born

What I have decided is to go through each section of the modules starting with the Importing/Expoerting data. While going through the exercises, I will record what I have learnt so that I remember that I did learn ;-) I promise myself that I will cover each module in one week. Fingers crossed.
