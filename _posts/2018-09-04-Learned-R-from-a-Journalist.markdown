## A borrwed title, “not that there’s anything wrong with that”

Adorning the title of this first blog post with a line from Sienfeld – “not that there’s anything wrong with that” - gives me great pleasure and satisfaction. For those of you who are interested, this dialogue was delivered (many times) in the “The Outing”, the 57th episode of Seinfeld.


## Learn R, Learn R Not

It has happened many a time to me; I started R with great excitement and then got discouraged soon when I was unable to get the data, get it properly in R. In hindsight, that was because of an availablity of abundance of resources. Each resource had a different way of doing the same thing. Some had a more puritain approach where Base R must be learnt before anything else. Others propogated short-cuts which went over my head. Talk about irony.


## Stumbling Upon R(happiness)

This time proved to different. How?

The objective of this course [Introduction to R for Journalists: How to Find Great Stories in Data](https://journalismcourses.org/RC0818.html) at its most basic, obviously is to teach journalists how to use R. (You might have to sign up to access the course.) The instructor has assumed nothing. He has covered the basics of R, and how man how thoroughly he did that is amazing.


## Course and its details

While he covered the basics, he realized – thankfully – that Base R is not the best to teach basics. So he did it with the Tidyverse packages.

The course has six modules, as follows:

1. How to use R
2. Importing/Exporting data
3. Wrangling data
4. Visualizing data
5. Spatial analysis
6. Publishing
7. Git

Please explore the modules yourself. Each module is elaborate and doesn’t leave anything to chance. For example, Importing/Exporting data goes through importing from five different types of files: CSV, Excel, Delimited, JSON and SPSS. And that is not all. It also covers copying and pasting data – something which the instructor discourages – and folder of files.


## Help of a friend

The friend who referred the course – a Machine Learning expert – to me is kind of caught in the middle. I do the course exercises, note the questions and then discuss with him. Most of my questions are to clarify certain concepts or some thoughts which I note down during the note taking.


## And an(other) R Blog is born

Given the (relative to my previous performance) progress I have made, I decided to take it seriously and write down my learning experiences for better retention. I will go through each section of the modules starting with the Importing/Expoerting data. While going through the exercises, I will record my notes, discuss them with the friend, add those discussion points to the notes, and then publish them for the myself and posterity (wink, wink), so that I remember that I did learn ;-) Fingers crossed.
